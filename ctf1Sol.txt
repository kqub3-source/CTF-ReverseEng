Reverse engineering C++ code to obtain the corresponding assembly code typically requires a compiler that can generate assembly output. However, I can explain the general process of how a C++ program like the one you provided would be compiled into assembly code.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Compilation**: When you compile C++ code, the compiler translates your high-level C++ instructions into machine code that can be executed by the processor. As an intermediate step, the compiler may generate assembly language code.

2. **Assembly Code**: Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is a human-readable form of machine code. It consists of instructions that correspond directly to operations the CPU can perform.

3. **Decompilation**: The process of decompilation involves translating machine code back into a higher-level language or readable assembly code. This is often not straightforward due to optimizations and loss of high-level constructs.

### Decompiled Assembly Code (Conceptual)

Here is a conceptual breakdown of how some parts of your C++ code might translate into assembly. Note that the exact assembly code can vary depending on the compiler, the CPU architecture, and the optimization level.

#### 1. **Variable Declarations**
   - `std::string inputString` and `std::string numericString` are objects that would involve calls to the string constructor in assembly.

   - Assembly might include calls to constructors:
     ```asm
     call    std::string::string()
     ```

#### 2. **User Input**
   - `std::cin >> inputString;` might translate to assembly instructions that call the `std::cin` objectâ€™s input function.
   
     ```asm
     call    std::basic_istream::operator>>()
     ```

#### 3. **ASCII Multiplication and Addition**
   - The loop iterating over each character would involve moving the character into a register, converting it to an integer (its ASCII value), then multiplying and adding.

     ```asm
     mov     al, byte ptr [inputString + index]
     movsx   eax, al       ; Sign-extend the byte to a 32-bit integer
     imul    rax, rax, asciiProduct ; Multiply
     add     rbx, rax      ; Accumulate the sum
     ```

#### 4. **Division Operation**
   - The division operation would involve an assembly division instruction, likely `div` for unsigned or `idiv` for signed division.
   
     ```asm
     mov     rax, asciiProduct
     cqo                      ; Sign extend RAX into RDX
     idiv    rbx              ; Divide RDX:RAX by RBX, quotient in RAX
     mov     quotient, rax    ; Store result in quotient
     ```

#### 5. **Comparison and Output**
   - Comparing the quotient to the user-provided key might involve converting the integer to a string, followed by a string comparison.

     ```asm
     call    std::to_string()
     call    std::basic_string::compare()
     ```

   - Depending on the result, a jump instruction (`je` for equal, `jne` for not equal) would determine which message to print.

     ```asm
     jne     invalid_key
     ```

#### 6. **Output Messages**
   - The final output would involve printing strings, likely through calls to `std::cout`.

     ```asm
     call    std::basic_ostream::operator<<()
     ```

### Conclusion

The actual assembly code generated will vary significantly based on the compiler and specific processor architecture (e.g., x86, ARM). The conceptual steps above give a rough idea of what the corresponding assembly instructions might look like after compiling your C++ program. To obtain the exact assembly code, you would need to use a tool like `g++` with the `-S` option to generate the assembly file from your C++ code:

```bash
g++ -S -o output.asm input.cpp
```

This command would generate an assembly file (`output.asm`) containing the assembly equivalent of your C++ program.
